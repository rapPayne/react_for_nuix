# Testing React events

The seat selection component should allow the user to see all the seats. Some are available, some are reserved, and in a few minutes, some will be added to your user's cart. These should all be visibly different. When the user clicks on an available seat, it should be added to their cart. If they click on a seat in their cart, it should be removed from their cart. Seats that are reserved cannot be clicked.

- Edit your seat selection tests.
- Along with your pair programming partner, one by one, write tests that verify the above behavior. Then make those tests pass.
